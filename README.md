# Facebook Cleanser

This small extension, when activated, will hide all the "crap" posts from your feed.
This means all shared posts, commented on posts and liked posts will be collapsed so you should only be left with original content from your friends.

By clicking the collapsed item you can view it and clicking the title again will collapse it again.

NOTE: This extension only works with Facebook set to English.
